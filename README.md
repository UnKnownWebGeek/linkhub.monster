### Overview
The **Personal Bio Page** is a self-hosted, customizable, and responsive webpage designed to manage and showcase personal or professional links. This project allows users to create a central bio page with features like link management, sub-bio pages, and an admin UI for easy updates. Inspired by popular bio page generators, this project is built with scalability in mind, using the latest design trends, such as fluted motion.

### Features

- **Sub-Bio Pages**: Dynamically create and manage sub-bio pages for various projects or aspects of your personal/professional life, accessible via subdomains or subdirectories.

- **Scalable**: Sub-bio page management allows you to add projects or sections dynamically as your needs grow.

### Sub-Bio Pages
This feature allows you to create additional bio pages for different projects or aspects of your personal or professional life. These sub-bio pages can be set up using:
- **Subdomains**: e.g., `project1.yourdomain.com`
- **Subdirectories**: e.g., `yourdomain.com/project1`

Sub-bio pages will use the same admin interface for easy management and will inherit the main bio page's design with customization options.

### Admin UI
The Admin UI provides a **WordPress-style interface** to manage:
- **Main Bio Page Content**: Bio information, images, and main links.
- **Sub-Bio Pages**: Creation, editing, and deletion of sub-bio pages.
- **Analytics**: View Google Analytics data for page views, traffic, and link clicks.
- **Customization**: Manage design settings, themes, and fluted motion effects.

### Fluted Motion Design
